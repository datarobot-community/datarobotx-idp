# Linters Docs

Linters list can be easily extended by adding new linter to the docker image and adding a new script to the `linters` directory.

### How to add a new linter

First of all you should add linter installation to the docker\`s Dockerfile. For example, if you want to add linter for `R` language, you should add the following lines to the `docker/linter/Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
ARG R_VERSION=4.2.2
RUN curl -O https://cdn.rstudio.com/r/centos-8/pkgs/R-${R_VERSION}-1-1.x86_64.rpm \
  && rpm -i R-${R_VERSION}-1-1.x86_64.rpm \
  && rm R-${R_VERSION}-1-1.x86_64.rpm \
  && ln -s /opt/R/${R_VERSION}/bin/R /usr/local/bin/R \
  && ln -s /opt/R/${R_VERSION}/bin/Rscript /usr/local/bin/Rscript

RUN R -e "install.packages('lintr', repos='http://cran.us.r-project.org')"
```
> Be sure that you bumped version of linter image before merging your PR with a new linter in docker image.

Then you should add a script to linters directory. For example, if you want to add linter for `R` language, you should add the following script (`lint_r.sh`) to the (`./linters/lint_r.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
files="$1"
fix_param="$2"
file_format="R"

if [ "$fix_param" = "--fix" ]; then
    echo "ðŸ˜” Fix command for $file_format files not implemented yet"
    exit 0
else
    # Run the linter
    echo "ðŸ”¬ Checking $file_format files..."
  ./linters/run_linter.sh  "R -e \"lintr::lint('$files')\""
fi

exit 0
```
Each linter script has a similar structure. It should accept two parameters: `files` and `fix_param`. The `files` parameter is a list of files that should be checked by the linter. The `fix_param` parameter is a flag that indicates whether the linter should fix the issues automatically or not(if it is supported).

After that you can run make command `make lint-r` it will build a new docker image and run the linter for `R` language.

### How to run linter

To run linter for a specific language you should run the following command:

```bash
make lint-<language>
```

### How to run "--fix" command for linter(if it is supported)

To run "--fix" command for a specific language you should run the following command:

```bash
make fix-<language>
```
all fix functionality are implemented in specific linter script files, like `./linters/lint_<language>.sh`.
